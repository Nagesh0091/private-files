    "# 📌 **KNN Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "**KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** is a **supervised learning algorithm** that **predicts the label of a data point by finding the 'K' most similar neighbors** and making the prediction based on those neighbors. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑🔍\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 **Key Things to Know About KNN**\n",
    "\n",
    "🔢 **1. K-value (Number of Neighbors):**\n",
    "\n",
    "* You choose how many neighbors (K) to look at.\n",
    "* Example: If **K = 3**, the algorithm checks the **3 nearest points**.\n",
    "* 🧠 Tip: K should be an **odd number** to avoid ties in classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**K in KNN:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Low K (e.g., 1-3):** More sensitive, can overfit 🐉.\n",
    "* **High K (e.g., 15+):** Less sensitive, can underfit 🦖.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key:** Small K = complex, large K = generalized. 🎯\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "📏 **2. Distance Metric:**\n",
    "KNN finds the **closest points** using distance formulas:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Euclidean Distance (most common)** 📐\n",
    "* Manhattan Distance 🛣️\n",
    "* Minkowski Distance 🧮\n",
    "\n",
    "🔄 **3. Lazy Learner:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* KNN **doesn’t learn during training**.\n",
    "* It **stores all data** and **predicts only when needed** (called **lazy learning**) 🐢💤\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 **4. Works for:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Classification** (e.g., spam or not spam 📧🚫)\n",
    "* **Regression** (e.g., predicting price 💵)\n",
    "\n",
    "⚖️ **5. Sensitive to:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Outliers** 😬\n",
    "* **Irrelevant features** 🤷\n",
    "* **Feature scaling** (must **normalize** or **standardize** the data!) 📊\n",
    "\n",
    "📝 **6. How It Works:**\n",
    "KNN **finds the 'K' most similar neighbors** to the input data point, then **makes predictions based on those neighbors' labels**. Think of it like asking your closest neighbors what they think! 🏘️💬\n",
    "\n",
    "🐢 **7. Slow for large datasets:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Because it **calculates distance for each test point**, it can be **slow** for large data 📉\n",

    "- It’s like measuring the shortest path between two locations on a map 🗺️.\n",
