    "## 📌 **Simple Definition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering algorithms find patterns in data and **group similar items together**. Each group is called a **cluster** 🧩.\n",

    "## ✨ **Why Use Clustering?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* To **find hidden patterns** 🕵️‍♂️\n",

    "## 🧮 **Steps in Clustering:**\n",

    "1. 📥 **Input Data** – No labels needed\n",

    "## 🔎 **What is an Elbow Graph?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Elbow Graph** helps you **choose the best number of clusters (K)** for **K-Means Clustering** by showing how the **error decreases** as K increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 **How It Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run K-Means for different values of **K** (e.g., 1 to 10).\n",
    "2. Calculate the **Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)** for each K.\n",
    "3. Plot a graph of **K (x-axis)** vs **WCSS (y-axis)**.\n",
    "4. Look for the point where the **curve bends like an elbow** 💪 — that’s the best K!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 **Key Term:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares)**:\n",
    " - The total distance between each point and its cluster center.\n",
    " - Lower WCSS means tighter clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📌 **Why “Elbow”?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Because the graph looks like an **arm bending at the elbow** 🦾.\n",
    "- The point where the WCSS **stops decreasing sharply** is the ideal K.\n",
