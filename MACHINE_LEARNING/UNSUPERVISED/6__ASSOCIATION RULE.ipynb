    "## 📌 **Association Rule Algorithms** –\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 **Definition (In Simple Words):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Association rule algorithms find relationships between items in large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 *“If a person buys bread 🍞, they are likely to buy butter 🧈 too.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📖 **Key Terms to Know:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **🛒 Itemset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   A group of items bought together (e.g., {milk, bread}).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **📏 Support:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   How often an itemset appears in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   🧮 *Support(A) = (Transactions with A) / (Total transactions)*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **📈 Confidence:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   How often item B is bought when item A is bought.\n",
    "\n",
    "   🧮 *Confidence(A → B) = Support(A and B) / Support(A)*\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **📊 Lift:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Measures how much more likely B is bought when A is bought, compared to chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "   🧮 *Lift = Confidence / Support(B)*\n",
    "\n",
    "   ✅ Lift > 1 → Positive association\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ **Popular Algorithms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Apriori 🧮:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Checks all possible combinations of items using a bottom-up approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "   🚧 Can be slow if dataset is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Eclat 🚀:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Uses a depth-first search with set intersections.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ✅ Faster than Apriori on some datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **FP-Growth 🌲:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Uses a compact tree structure (FP-tree) to find frequent patterns without generating all combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ⚡ Very fast and memory efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📂 **Where It's Used:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* 🛍️ Market Basket Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "* 🎥 Recommendation Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "* 📊 Customer Behavior Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "* 💊 Medical Diagnosis (symptom → disease)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 **Example Rule:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If {diapers, milk} → {baby wipes}\n",
    "\n",
    "* Support = 15%\n",
    "* Confidence = 70%\n",
    "* Lift = 2.3\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Means baby wipes are 2.3x more likely to be bought with diapers and milk.\n",
    "\n",
