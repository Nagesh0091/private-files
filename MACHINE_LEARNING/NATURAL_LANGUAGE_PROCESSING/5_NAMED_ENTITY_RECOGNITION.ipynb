    "\n",
    "> 📘 **Definition**\n",
    "> NER is a **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** technique used to **identify and classify named entities** (like people, places, organizations, dates, etc.) in text into predefined categories.\n",

    "## ⚙️ **How NER Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "NER generally works in 3 main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 🧹 **Preprocessing**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Tokenization ✂️ (splitting text into words/tokens)\n",
    "   * POS tagging 🏷️ (Part-of-Speech tagging)\n",
    "   * Lemmatization/Normalization ✨\n",
    "\n",
    "2. 🧠 **Entity Detection**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The algorithm detects chunks of text that could be entities (e.g., \"Barack Obama\").\n",
    "\n",
    "3. 🏷️ **Entity Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Each detected entity is classified into categories like:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * 👤 Person\n",
    "     * 🌍 Location\n",
    "     * 🏢 Organization\n",
    "     * 📅 Date\n",
